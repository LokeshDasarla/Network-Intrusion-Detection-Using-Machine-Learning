 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Using Supervised Machine Learning

ABSTRACT
Network intrusion detection is crucial for protecting computer networks from malicious attacks. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have limitations in handling new and evolving threats. This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using supervised machine learning, employing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to detect malicious network traffic. Preprocessing and feature extraction techniques, such as normalization and dimensionality reduction, are used to optimize model performance. The system is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project aims to improve detection accuracy and minimize false positives, highlighting the potential of machine learning in enhancing network security.

Project Objectives:
1. **Supervised Model Training**: Utilize algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM to classify network traffic using labeled datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identify relevant features from network data to differentiate between normal and malicious traffic.
3. **Real-Time Detection**: Implement a system capable of analyzing traffic in real time and alerting on deviations from normal behavior.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Use metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the efficiency of different models.
5. **Traffic Simulation**: Test the system with simulated real-world scenarios, including various types of attacks.
6. **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale to larger network environments.
7. **Visualization**: Provide a user-friendly GUI for real-time monitoring of detection results.
